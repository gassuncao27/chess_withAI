V - f(board)

What is V? (the bellmans equation)
V = -1 black win board state
V = 0 draw board state
V = 1 white wins board state

Should we fix the value of the initial board state?

What's the value of "about to lose"?

Simpler:
All positions where white wins = 1
All positions where drawn = 0
All positions where black wins = -1
